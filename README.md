# Open Air Quality
## Open Source Geospatio-temporal Sensing, Visualization, and Analytics
to Support Air Quality Policy and Management in Cities

This project addresses the need for urban areas to collect and analyze air quality data in an effort to protect human health. It maps and analyzes air pollution data collected from two urban locations around the world: Kathmandu, Nepal, and Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. In each case, there are specific public policy and management questions related to understanding the air quality situation, and investigating possible public policy and management responses to air quality issues. 

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a low-cost, open source and user friendly monitoring system for data collection on air quality in urban areas, and to demonstrate NASA <a href = "https://webworldwind.org/">Web World Wind</a> visualization and data analytics to investigate the particular policy or management questions for urban cases.
